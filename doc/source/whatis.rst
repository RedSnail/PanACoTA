What is genomeAPCAT
*******************

``genomeAPCAT`` is a software providing tools for large scale bacterial comparative genomics. From a set of complete and/or draft genomes, you can:

- Do a quality control of your strains, to eliminate poor quality genomes, which would not give any information for the comparative study
- Uniformly annotate all genomes
- Do a Pan-genome
- Do a Core or Persistent genome
- Align all Core/Persistent families
- Infer a phylogenetic tree from the Core/Persistent families
